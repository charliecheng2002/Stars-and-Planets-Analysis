# Project 11 (P11) grading rubric

## Code reviews

- A TA / grader will be reviewing your code after the deadline.
- They will make deductions based on the Rubric provided below.
- To ensure that you donâ€™t lose any points in code review, you must review the rubric and make sure that you have followed the instructions provided in the project correctly.

## Rubric

### General guidelines:

- Displaying excessive irrelevant information (-3)
- Outputs not visible/did not save the notebook file prior to running the cell containing "export". We cannot see your output if you do not save before generating the zip file. (-3)
- Used concepts/modules (like `csv.DictReader`, `pandas`, `os.path.walk`) not covered in class yet (built-in functions that you have been introduced to can be used) (-3)
- `import` statements are not mentioned in the required cell at the top of the notebook or used additional import statements beyond those that are stated in the directions (-3)
